# Game Bingo Board for Prince of Persia

### Running:

1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Go to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser

### Known issues:

- board gets ugly if there are not enough tasks to fill the board (too many tasks disabled)
- very long task names can overflow the grid cell

### Roadmap:

- automatic highlighting once a Bingo is completed
- data should be loaded from JSON
- same for apperance configuration
